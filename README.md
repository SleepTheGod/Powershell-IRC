# Powershell-IRC
Chat and connect with users using powershell by Taylor Christian Newsome
Open a text editor like Notepad or any code editor.
Copy and paste the script below into the editor.
Save the file with a .ps1 extension, such as ChatWithIRC.ps1.
Users can execute this script from the PowerShell command line by navigating to the directory where the script is saved and running it with optional parameters for the IRC server and channel. For example .\ChatWithIRC.ps1 -IRCServer irc.example.com -Channel "#examplechannel"
This command will connect the user to the specified IRC server and channel. If no parameters are provided, it will use default values (irc.efnet.org and #testchannel).
